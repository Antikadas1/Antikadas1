                                                                                       Thank you for taking time to review my github.
                                                                                                      
 ### To the recruiters

Short Description about my interest, experience and profession : I am a final semester masters student of Computer Science Autonoumous system at EÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd University,Budapest, Hungary. My course mostly involved deeper knowledge of data mining, machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, sensor fuision. During my course I aquired a great knowledge of above mentioned topic while I mostly enjoyed working with machine learning and deep learning, specifically convolutional neural network.My research project and thesis topic are the same "Reduce the FN rate using traditional machine learning for clustering and CNN for feature extraction from Cancer images".This project is a combined effort of human knowledge and deep learning/machine learning approches to reduce the False negative rate of the efficient net classifier. Besides this, doing data visulazation, EDA analysis of different types of data from kaggle, such as sports(cricket,football),pricing  etc and use ML or DL techniques, sometimes both to find out which one is better in which use cases go into a part of my interest and  daily routines . I am always widening my knowledge and interest in the field of AI and Data Science by taking part in the kaggle compettitions, tutoring students, writing blogs, taking small courses.As a learner I belive knowledge can not be sufficient enough, and what wonder can we do with data is marvelous. My apporch to any data project is look though the small things with minute details, try all the parametric combination, think more and more relate to real life,and then apply techniques to find out something from the data which I did not think I would discover. Currently,I am looking for any opportunity related to Data analysis,Data Science, AI where I can devlope my knowdlege by enhancing company's achievement thorugh me and my teammates.
